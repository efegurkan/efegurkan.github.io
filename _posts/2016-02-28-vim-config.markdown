Merhaba,

So this is the story of how it is started and going on. So lets start with the
story part.

I currently do develop web apps as my daily job. Before that I worked on
LibreOffice as a GSoC participant. This was the most job-like thing I did before
working as FE developer at [Linovi](http://www.linovi.com).

Among my colleagues and friends who work as developers, it is common to use
popular IDE's. I believe it is a worldwide thing since most of us start
programming on IDE's at school. Most of the front-end guys I know use
IntelliJ/Webstorm or Sublime. I did also use IntelliJ/Webstorm about a year.
It is a fine IDE to use in most cases for most people. It is open source and
free to use (without half of its functionality). It has its own pros and cons of
course. It has too many features with Ultimate editon but it costs a lot and it
is not open source.

I did use vim before, during the GSoC because at that time LibreOffice code was
too big (actually still too big) so no IDE's can handle the indexing. So my best
option was using a text editor. I could use either vim or emacs at that time.
One of my [friends](http://www.github.com/enesates) used vim during his
internship, so I have chosen my new text editor with his suggestion.

As a sophomore Computer Engineering student I was in a  desperate need for
autocompletion to code. So that was when I discovered plugins. With the help of
ctags you could handle the autocompletion which IDE's failed to. Also you can
highlight syntax etc with vim so it has the potential to become an IDE with
the help of the plugins.

So this was the story of how I started to use  vim as IDE. Now I do not have to
use vim and I can use some other IDE. But I do find IDE's too bulky to do editing.
They also have their plugins to handle stuff therefore it makes them bulkier. You 
may have performance problems with vim also with plugins but it is way more lighter
than IDE's in general.

What are my other options then; Sublime? is not open source, Atom looks
promising for now I will stick with vim. MS Visual Studio Code is also open
source however it is from Microsoft. I DO NOT want to use anything from Microsoft
until I believe they changed. This is a subject that I argue a lot with one of my
friends. There is an obvious change on Microsoft but until I am fully convinced,
I will probably stay away unless I have a desperate need to use.

### My config

Rule of thumb - Search what you need to do with vim! There is a plugin for that!

My vim config lives in [here](http://www.github.com/efegurkan/dotfiles). I
change my config time to time. It is based on Fatih Arslan's [vimrc](https://github.com/fatih/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc).
Go check his dotfiles there are many more stuff you may like.

My config is self explainatory in general just read the comment lines.
Feel free to use it, change it, and share your thoughts on [here](http://www.twitter.com/efegurkan).

Until next time.
Cheers,
